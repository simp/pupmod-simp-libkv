Files in this directory are for the consul simpkv provider tests
(spec tests and what appears to be manual tests).  The files have
been moved from the top directory to here, but

  **HAVE NOT BEEN FIXED**

Also, it is unclear if the Vagrantfile needs to be moved back into
top-level directory in order for TraviCI to be able to use the
'vagrant' service that is configured in the .travis.yml....Couldn't
find any documentation on the vagrant service.
